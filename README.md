# Create recommendations for running routes

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Create system which would diplay recommendations tailored to each runners based on prefered distance and training effect. System exports gpx file for selected route.  


## Background

As an active runner, I often deal with inventing new running routes. Alternatively, I am looking for routes in places where I am temporarily on vacation or on a business trip.


## How is it used?

The app would anonymously record the routes of all runners at different locations, including the runner's speed, heart rate and performance parameters. The user would enter the requirements for the route: length, profile, elevation, surface, distance from the specified location and the application would recommend suitable routes.
The application would also make a comparison with my current performance and estimate the time needed to run the selected routes in several training modes: rest, maintenance, improvement.
The application could then export the selected route in gpx format.



## Data sources and AI methods
Data come from different sport app as Strava, where users give their consent to use their records for these purposes. 

## Challenges

There must be enough runners willing to share their routes

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
